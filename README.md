# LaTeX for linguistics

## What is it?

- The origins: __TeX__. Dates back to the late 70s/early 80s (Don Knuth). For *formatting* text for technical documents.

  See [`texdoc gentle`](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/gentle).

- __LaTeX__: easy(!)-to-use version for authors (Leslie Lamport). The point: describe *content*, formatting separate.

  For decades, and still today, LaTeX is the standard format/program for technical writing (in lots of fields, including linguistics).


## Basic resources

Use locally or on the cloud (or both).

- __on the cloud__: [Overleaf.com](http://overleaf.com) (or other services)
- __locally__: Install a TeX distribution [from latex-project.org](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions) (TeX programs, and many packages and fonts)

  - even if you don't use LaTeX locally, some useful tools to install are:
    - [LaTeXiT](https://www.chachatelier.fr/latexit/) (LaTeX stnippet -> image)
    - [deTeXify](https://detexify.kirelabs.org/classify.html) (handwriting -> LaTeX symbol)

### Resources

- A method I use for keeping all my references synched in one common `.bib` file: see the readme [here](https://github.com/postylem/allbib).
