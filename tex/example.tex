This is a simple example of a plain \TeX{} file.

\TeX{} is all about formatting.
{\it Here are a few words in an italic font}, {\bf a
few words in a boldface font}, {\it and a\/ {\bf mixture}
of the two, with two\/ {\rm roman words} inserted}.

Here is some math: ${6 \over 2} = 3$.

And more:
% define a macro
\def\arc#1{\cos #1 + i \sin #1}

$$e^{i\cdot2t} = {\arc{2t}}$$

$$\int_0^\pi \arc{\theta}\,{\rm d}\theta = 2i$$

That's all.
